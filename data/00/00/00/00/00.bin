Hi.

166
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,666
I made macaroni if you want some.

167
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,208
I'm sorry. What?

168
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,625
Well, I was starving and you took forever.

169
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,666
So I wanted to make food.

170
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,708
What do you want?

171
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,291
Relax, Kate Bishop.
I just want to talk, okay?

172
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,375
Are you really not hungry?

173
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,916
That fight was so long.

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,875
It's really tasty. Really tasty.

175
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,125
I know what boxed mac and cheese
tastes like.

No.

179
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,916
You have one fork?

-I'm one person.
-That's so weird.

This is not cutlery.

I am not gonna have dinner with you

after you tried to kill me
and then broke into my house.

184
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,500
I did not try to kill you.

185
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,750
A, I put you on a wire
to remove an obstacle.

186
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,958
And B, I did not break anything.

I am way too talented than that.

188
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:45,000
And C, stop being so defensive. Okay?

189
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,333
You're so hostile.

Okay, I take that back.

I don't have any weapons
currently in my hands.

Yes.

You are so fond of him.

It tells me
you don't really know who he is.

He came out here to protect me.

285
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,250
No. He came here
to protect his reputation.

286
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,833
Do you know how many people he killed?

it could wrap around the entire world.

292
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,250
That it holds so much power.

293
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,250
You call him a hero
no matter what he does?

294
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,041
It means that when you choose
to spend your life trying to help people,

295
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,625
there are going to be things
that you lose.

296
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,666
When you face
the kind of threats that he has,

297
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,458
there's going to be collateral damage.

What? No. No, that is... No.

She's gone.

301
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,208
Is she collateral damage?

302
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,750
No, look, there is no way
that that is true.

303
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,541
He would not let that happen.

How long have you known Clint Barton?

305
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,083
About a week.

306
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,791
It will not be difficult
for me to complete this assignment.

307
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,250
Wait a minute,
somebody hired you to kill him?

308
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,666
All I'll say is that
if there is someone out there

309
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,541
that is telling you Clint is a bad guy,

310
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,916
then maybe you should ask yourself
what kind of person hired you.

311
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,875
He is not perfect.
Nobody's perfect. But he is good.

312
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:56,083
However he convinced you about who he is

313
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,541
or how many people think
or call him a hero,

314
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,000
truth is it doesn't matter.

315
